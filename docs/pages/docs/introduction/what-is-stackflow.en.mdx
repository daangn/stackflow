# What is Stackflow?

**Stackflow** is a project that implements Stack Navigation UX, commonly used in mobile devices (iOS/Android, etc.), in a JavaScript environment, making it easier to develop hybrid apps and webviews.

- Stacks screens and maintains scroll position.
- Supports transition effects for stacking screens and disappearing screens when navigating back.
- Supports iOS-style swipe-back gestures for navigating back.
- Passes necessary parameters to the transitioning screen.

So, what advantages does **Stackflow** have compared to existing navigation libraries?

- You can use the stack and transition state without any UI, allowing you to customize the UI as you like.
- You can inject desired extensions into the lifecycle through the plugin interface.
- The core logic and integration layer are separated, allowing integration with various frontend frameworks.
- You can inject render logic and UI externally, enabling simultaneous development of mobile webviews and desktop applications from a single codebase.
- Supports Server-Side Rendering. (`ReactDOMServer.renderToString`)
