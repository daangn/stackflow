# LLMs.txt

We provide an LLMs.txt setup to help large language models (LLMs) easily understand Stackflow.

### Structure

We provide the following LLMs.txt files:

- [llms.txt](https://stackflow.so/llms.txt): The main file that describes the structure of all LLMs.txt files.
- [llms-full.txt](https://stackflow.so/llms-full.txt): Includes all Stackflow documentation.
- [llms-changelog.txt](https://stackflow.so/llms-changelog.txt): Contains the latest updates and changes so you can review version-by-version history.

### Using with AI tools
#### Cursor
You can include the LLMs.txt files in your project using Cursor's @Docs feature.
